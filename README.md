To run this project you need:


1) JRE System Lib (recommend[java-1.8.0])


2) JUnit (only for test.java)


3) com.microsoft.z3.jar: you need to build z3 (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.git) for JAVA api and copy your com.microsoft.z3.jar, libz3.so and libz3java.so into lib folder


There are 8 test cases in test.java. The last three take about one minute. Each test case will output a list of counterexample if it exists.
